        A Game of Thrones takes place over the course of one year on or near the
        fictional continent of Westeros. The story begins when King Robert
        visits the northern castle Winterfell to ask Ned Stark to be his
        right-hand assistant, or Hand of the King. The previous Hand, Jon Arryn,
        died under suspicious circumstances. Robert comes with his queen, Cersei
        Lannister, and his retinue, which includes a number of Lannisters. Just
        after the royal party arrives, Ned’s wife, Catelyn, receives a message
        claiming that the Lannister family was responsible for the death of the
        former Hand. She tells Ned, who accepts the position as Hand in order to
        protect Robert from the Lannisters. Ned’s son Bran then discovers Cersei
        Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister having sex, and Jaime pushes
        Bran from a window to silence him. Everyone thinks Bran simply fell
        while climbing around the castle. While Bran is still unconscious, Ned
        leaves Winterfell and rides south with Robert. The same day, Ned’s
        bastard son, Jon, leaves to serve at the Wall, a massive structure that
        protects Westeros from the wilderness of the far North. The group of men
        sworn to defend the Wall, the Night’s Watch, have been receiving reports
        of strange creatures and have been losing men with increasing frequency.
        Tyrion Lannister, a little person who is brother to Cersei and Jaime,
        travels with Jon to the Wall to see the massive structure.
